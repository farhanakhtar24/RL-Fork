<!-- ## Overview

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (at least version 12.x or higher)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rancholabs/webD.team-Farhan.git
```

## Install Dependencies

Change into the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd webD.team-Farhan
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm
```

## Start the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The development server will be up and running at http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in your browser to view the application.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page will auto-update as you make changes to the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
